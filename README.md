To execute the exercise file in the terminal:

```bash
node exercises/ex01.js
```

> **NOTE:** Once you are done with each exercise, create a new commit and push it to the remote repository. Provide the exercise number in the message of each commit. In case you want to modify a previous exercise already pushed, mention that is a refactor.

```bash
git commit -m "exercise 1 completed"
```

```bash
git commit -m "refactoring: exercise 1"
```
